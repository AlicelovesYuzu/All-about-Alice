                        <strong>Did you know?</strong> The International Skating Union (ISU) governs all international figure skating 
                        competitions, establishing rules, judging standards, and competition formats that ensure fairness and 
                        consistency across events worldwide.

                        <p>
                            The ultimate honor in figure skating, held every four years as part of the Winter Olympic Games. 
                            Skaters compete for their countries in four disciplines: men's singles, women's singles, pairs, 
                            and ice dance. The Olympic figure skating competition has produced some of the sport's most 
                            memorable moments and legendary athletes.

                        <p>
                            The most prestigious annual competition in figure skating, typically held in March. The World 
                            Championships determine the best skaters in each discipline for the season. Qualification is 
                            based on national quotas earned through previous year's results, making entry highly competitive.

                            of skating stars. Many Olympic champions first gained international recognition at this event.

                            The oldest ISU championship (first held in 1891), open to skaters from European member nations. 
                            Traditionally dominated by Russian, French, and Italian skaters, this January event serves as

                            Asia, Africa, and Oceania). Provides valuable international experience for skaters from 
                            developing skating nations and serves as a key competition in the Olympic qualification process.

                        <strong>Competition Format:</strong> Most senior international competitions feature two segments - 
                        the Short Program (2 minutes 40 seconds) with required elements, and the Free Skate (4 minutes for 
                        women, 4½ minutes for men) that allows more creative freedom. The combined score determines final 
                        placements.
