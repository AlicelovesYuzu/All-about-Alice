        <h2>Figure Skating (Figure Skating) movement recognition and scoring system</h2> 
        <h3>Training and optimization of figure skating movement recognition and scoring based on LRCN model</h3> 

            <h3>Research theme
                <p>Figure skating is an ice sport in which athletes use skates to draw figures on the ice and perform difficult movements such as jumping and spinning. Figure skating judges will be based on the quality of the movement and artistic performance of the comprehensive score, is a combination of art and sports. Figure skating has a huge impact around the world and is one of the core sports of the Winter Olympic Games, attracting the attention of a global audience.
                    In addition to the Olympic Games, figure skating has many international competitions and tournaments, such as the World Figure Skating Championships, European Figure Skating Championships, Four Continents Figure Skating Championships and so on.</p>
            <h3>Important concept interpretation
                <p>There are three main types of figure skating moves: jump, spin, and step sequence. In the men's and women's singles and pairs competitions, skaters will compete in both the short program and the free skate. Overall, the final score of the contestants is calculated by adding the technical action points and the program content points, and subtracting all the points deducted, and the highest score is the champion.</p>
            <h3>Significance and value
                <p>Figure skating is one of the sports with the most complex competition rules and the highest scoring difficulty, and there is currently no mature artificial intelligence model in the world to evaluate and score figure skating movements. Using artificial intelligence model to score can effectively reduce the workload of judges and improve efficiency. And artificial intelligence can ignore distractions such as lights, music, and off-site noise to make the score more objective.
                    In addition, the movement recognition and intelligent scoring system can also help figure skating beginners to improve their self-practice techniques and movements. The fairness and accuracy of AI are lacking in figure skating competitions at present. Artificial evaluation and scoring tend to have greater errors and even subjective colors. Therefore, the application of AI will make the scoring of competitions more objective and fair, which has high theoretical and practical significance.</p>
