                <h2>My Figure Skating Philosophy</h2>
                <p>Having skated for 10 years, figure skating is not just a sport for me; it's a form of art and self-expression. Through each routine, I strive to convey emotions and stories, captivating the audience with every movement on the ice.

                <p>
                    My passion for ice skating taught me that perfection is not a destination, but a relentless pursuit of balance—between power and grace, between technical precision and emotional storytelling. That same pursuit is what drew me to AI and mathematics.

                <h2>My experiences in AI and mathematics</h2>
                <p>
                    Learning to code was like learning a new jump; it was frustrating, and required breaking down a complex problem into its most basic components. 
                    With a deep understanding of coding and AI models I learned at school, I managed to create my own project aligned with my pasion in skating.

                    My passion in coding and figure skating made me to create a website to introduce this unique sport with an innovative score calculator incorporated in.

                <h2>Dancing</h2>
                <p>I've started dancing since 5 years old, and through all the experiences in dancing trainings I could now choreograph programs on my own!</p>

                <h2>My daily moments</h2>
                <p>Traveled to Europe and many Asian countries at a yonug age, I am always open to new culture and people.
                The 2 years of living in North Carolina helped me to become a connector to the international stage in highschool and encourages me to seek more in my future college.
