                <h2>The Essence of Figure Skating</h2>
                <p>
                    Figure skating is a captivating winter sport that combines athletic prowess with artistic expression on ice. 
                    Skaters perform intricate footwork, breathtaking jumps, graceful spins, and dramatic lifts while interpreting 
                    music through movement. This unique blend of sport and art makes figure skating one of the most visually 
                    stunning and emotionally engaging competitions in the world.
                </p>
                
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p>
                        <strong>Did you know?</strong> Figure skating was the first winter sport to be included in the Olympic Games, 
                        making its debut at the 1908 Summer Olympics in London before the Winter Olympics even existed.
                    </p>
                </div>
                
                <h2>Olympic Disciplines</h2>
                <p>
                    Modern figure skating features four main Olympic disciplines, each with its own unique characteristics:
                </p>
                
                <h3>Men's and Women's Singles</h3>
                <p>
                    Individual skaters perform technical elements including jumps (like the Axel, Lutz, and Salchow), spins 
                    (such as the camel spin or sit spin), and step sequences. The women's event has been dominated by 
                    increasingly difficult quadruple jumps in recent years, while men continue to push technical boundaries.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Pair Skating</h3>
                <p>
                    A male and female skater perform together, incorporating elements unique to pairs such as overhead lifts, 
                    twist lifts, throw jumps, and death spirals. Pair skating requires perfect synchronization and tremendous 
                    strength, particularly from the male partner who must lift his partner with one arm extended overhead.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Ice Dance</h3>
                <p>
                    Focused more on intricate footwork, rhythm interpretation, and precise timing than jumps, ice dance 
                    emphasizes the musical and artistic aspects of skating. Dancers maintain contact for much of their program 
                    and perform complex step sequences and twizzles (traveling spins on one foot).
                </p>
                
                <h2>Non-Olympic Disciplines</h2>
                <p>
                    Beyond the Olympic events, figure skating includes several other exciting formats:
                </p>
                
                <h3>Synchronized Skating</h3>
                <p>
                    Teams of 8-20 skaters perform together in precise formations, creating moving patterns on ice. This 
                    discipline emphasizes teamwork and unison skating, with elements like blocks, circles, wheels, and 
                    intersections.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Theater on Ice</h3>
                <p>
                    Combining elements of theater, dance, and figure skating, these performances tell stories through 
                    choreographed routines performed by groups of skaters. Costumes, props, and dramatic interpretation 
                    play key roles.
                </p>
                
                <h2>Competition Structure</h2>
                <p>
                    From intermediate through senior-level competition, skaters generally perform two programs:
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    <strong>Short Program:</strong> A tightly choreographed 2 minute 40 second routine that includes required 
                    elements demonstrating the skater's technical mastery. Mistakes here can be costly as there's less 
                    opportunity to make up points later.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    <strong>Free Skate:</strong> A longer program (4 minutes for women, 4½ minutes for men) that allows more 
                    creative freedom while still requiring certain technical elements. This is where skaters can showcase 
                    their personality and push technical boundaries.
                </p>
                
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p>
                        <strong>Scoring Insight:</strong> Each element receives a score according to its base value and grade 
                        of execution (GOE), resulting in a combined technical elements score (TES). Judges evaluate skating 
                        skills, transitions, performance, composition, and interpretation of music for the program components 
                        score (PCS).
                    </p>
                </div>
                
                <h2>Figure Skating as Entertainment</h2>
                <p>
                    Beyond competition, figure skating has a vibrant show business aspect. Major competitions conclude with 
                    exhibition galas where top skaters perform non-competitive programs, often showcasing their personality 
                    and artistry beyond the constraints of competition rules. Many professional skaters tour with ice shows 
                    like Stars on Ice or Holiday on Ice, while others perform in resident shows at entertainment venues 
                    worldwide.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The sport's unique combination of athleticism and artistry continues to captivate audiences globally, 
                    making figure skating one of the most popular events at the Winter Olympics and a beloved form of 
                    entertainment year-round.
