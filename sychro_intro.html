                <h2>What is Synchronized Skating?</h2>
                <p>
                    Synchronized skating, affectionately called "synchro" by participants and fans, is a dynamic team sport where 8 to 20 skaters perform together as one cohesive unit. 
                    Teams glide across the ice at high speeds while executing intricate formations, precise footwork, and spectacular elements - all perfectly synchronized to music.
                </p>
                
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p>
                        <strong>Did you know?</strong> Synchronized skating is the fastest growing discipline in figure skating, with over 600 registered teams in the United States alone 
                        and thousands more worldwide. Despite its popularity, it remains one of the few figure skating disciplines not yet included in the Winter Olympics.

                </div>
                
                <h2>Key Characteristics</h2>
                <p>
                    What makes synchronized skating unique is the emphasis on teamwork and precision. Unlike singles or pairs skating where individuals or couples perform alone, 
                    synchro requires every team member to match their movements exactly with their teammates. The difficulty comes not just from executing elements, but doing so 
                    in perfect unison while maintaining complex formations at high speeds.
                </p>
                
                <h2>Competition Elements</h2>
                <p>
                    Synchronized skating programs consist of both required and creative elements that showcase the team's technical skills and artistic interpretation. 
                    The International Skating Union (ISU) recognizes several key elements that form the foundation of synchronized skating programs:

                        <h3>Blocks</h3>
                        <p>
                            Straight lines of skaters moving in unison, often with intricate footwork. Blocks may change configuration during the program, 
                            transforming from straight lines to serpentine shapes while maintaining perfect alignment.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Wheels</h3>
                        <p>
                            Circular formations where skaters rotate around a central point while performing synchronized footwork. Wheels can rotate clockwise or counterclockwise 
                            and often feature interesting variations like intersecting wheels or wheel-within-wheel patterns.

                        <p>
                            Linear formations where skaters move in parallel lines across the ice. Lines may perform synchronized turns, steps, or jumps while maintaining 
                            their formation and spacing.

                            High-speed maneuvers where groups of skaters pass through each other in carefully choreographed patterns. These thrilling elements require 
                            precise timing to avoid collisions while creating visually stunning effects.

                <h2>History and Development</h2>
                <p>
                    Synchronized skating originated in 1956 in Ann Arbor, Michigan, where Dr. Richard Porter formed the first precision skating team, the Hockettes. 
                    Originally called "precision skating," the sport emphasized the maintenance of intricate formations and required precise timing from all team members.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The sport grew rapidly in North America and Europe throughout the 1970s and 1980s. In 1994, the International Skating Union officially recognized 
                    synchronized skating as a discipline of figure skating and began holding World Championships in 2000. Today, countries like Finland, Sweden, 
                    Canada, and the United States dominate international competitions.

                        <strong>Olympic Dream:</strong> Synchronized skating has been proposed for inclusion in the Winter Olympics multiple times, most recently for the 2022 Games. 
                        While not yet an Olympic sport, the ISU continues to advocate for its inclusion, highlighting its unique team dynamics and growing global popularity.
